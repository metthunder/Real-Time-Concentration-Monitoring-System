# Real-Time Ammonia Concentration Monitoring System

This project monitors real-time ammonia (NHâ‚ƒ) concentration levels using the MQ-137 sensor connected to an Arduino UNO.  
In addition to live monitoring, an LSTM-based model is trained on historical data to predict future concentration trends.  
The predictions help in taking early action in case of dangerous gas levels.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

- **Sensor Data Acquisition**: Real-time ammonia concentration readings via MQ-137 + Arduino UNO.
- **LSTM-Based Forecasting**: Predicts future ammonia concentrations using a model trained on past data.
- **Web Dashboard**: Displays live sensor readings and predictions through an interactive web dashboard.
- **Alerts**: Monitor rising ammonia levels easily with predictive trends.

## Hardwares Used

- **MQ-137 Ammonia Gas Sensor
- **Arduino UNO
- **USB Cable for Arduino-PC communication
